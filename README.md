I have chosen to use an MVC-based architecture. With controllers being responsible for consuming the API and picking up their respective values.
I did not experience any major difficulties but I had some technical problems with the retrofit API.
I chose to use Retrofit 2 to do the json Parser and Glide to load the images. They are two well-established, easy-to-use libraries.
I completed only 50% of the application due to technical problems I had in updating my API through android Studio. It took me at least 40 minutes of my time.
It would take another hour to finish the application.
